/**
 * One cube's writeback fact, held still for the length of one statement.
 * <p>
 * A cube's fact source is not something a caller owns a copy of: rewriting it
 * to include a session's pending values rewrites what <em>every</em> query of
 * that cube reads, and the star built from it along with it. Two sessions doing
 * that at once read each other's uncommitted values, and whichever restores
 * last decides what the cube looks like afterwards - so the values one client
 * never committed become what the next client sees.
 * <p>
 * XMLA has no answer to this, because nothing in the protocol says a session's
 * pending writeback is private; it is [MS-SSAS] 3.1.3 saying a session is a
 * session, and a client that opens a transaction and then queries plainly
 * expecting its own values back. The engine's answer here is the blunt one:
 * only one statement at a time may have this cube's fact rewritten. Statements
 * on a writeback-enabled cube therefore queue behind each other. That is the
 * price, and it is paid only by cubes that declare a writeback table -
 * {@link #run} is never reached for the others.
 * <p>
 * The lock is reentrant because the work frequently runs further statements on
 * the same cube and the same thread: {@code UPDATE CUBE} resolves its tuple and
 * its value with MDX queries while the pending values are already in place.
