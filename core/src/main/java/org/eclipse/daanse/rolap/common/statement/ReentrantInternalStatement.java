/**
 * A statement that can be used for all of the various internal
 * operations, such as resolving MDX identifiers, that require a
 * {@link Statement} and an {@link ExecutionImpl}.
 *
 * The statement needs to be reentrant because there are many such
 * operations; several of these operations might be active at one time. We
 * don't want to create a new statement for each, but just one internal
 * statement for each connection. The statement shouldn't have a unique
 * execution. For this reason, we don't use the inherited {execution}
 * field.
 *
 * But there is a drawback. If we can't find the unique execution, the
 * statement cannot be canceled or time out. If you want that behavior
 * from an internal statement, use the base class: create a new
 * {@link InternalStatement} for each operation.
